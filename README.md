# Pyxia
Pyxia is a Privacy Focused, and Open Source Social Media, where we put Privacy before profit. 

# Notice for running

* You need to add a database for it to run, and will need to change configurations (mainly in main.py)
* You will need to either get a self signed SSL Certificate (server.crt) and a Private key to go along with it (server.key)
* Make sure you run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` There may be some requirements that haven't been added as I run this in an ENV and don't often need to reinstall things.
